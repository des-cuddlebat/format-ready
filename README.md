# Format Ready
A mod that allows use of $ in place of ยง for formatting; use $$ to enter dollar sign.

Messages are stored in chat history with ยง substituted, which enables copypasting them into command blocks or contexts where this mod is not present.

Works in singleplayer, or in multiplayer if the server has this mod installed too.
